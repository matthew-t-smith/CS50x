0.  BMP: 32 bit = 2^32 colors = 4,294,967,296
    GIF: 8 bit = 2^8 colors = 256
    JPEG: 24 bit = 2^24 colors = 16,777,216
    PNG: 24 bit = 2^24 colors = 16,777,216
1.  GIF; PNG doesn't, but formats were created to allow (APNG and MNG)
2.  lossy compression - once compressed, the quality is lost permanently
    lossless compression - compression that preserves the original quality
3.  JPEG
4.  2 things:
    1. The filename's first character is changed to signal that it's been 
        deleted in the directory entry.
    2. The file's FAT clusters are added to the directory of free clusters.
    Note, the file's data is never touched.
5.  Degauss with a Type I or II degausser, physically destroy the hard-drive,
    or (less so) overwrite with one of the 22 Gutmann patterns
6.  It is a header file that defines typedefs for exact-width integer types and
    the minimum and maximum values for those. It is used in the bmp.h header 
    file.
7.  By defining the exact widths (positive and negative for signed, positive
    only for unsigned) of integers in a program, it keeps irregularities from
    popping up when a program is run in different places that might manage
    any extra bits that are assigned.
8.  1, 4, 4, 8 bytes
9.  BM or 0x42 0x4D
10. bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file with regard to the type,
    size and layout of the actual file. It is found in the BITMAPFILEHEADER
    structure.
    biSize is the bytes required by the structure for dimension and color
    format. Found in the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure.
11. The file is top-down with the origin in the upper left corner; this also
    means it cannot be compressed.
12. biBitCount
13. In this "write" case, it must mean that the function cannot return a pointer
    to the file "outfile." When reading, it can mean that the file it is trying
    to open does not yet exist.
14. The 1 refers to the number of blocks. We are only needing to read from the
    file in question once, rather than reading from it multiple times however
    much space is specified per call.
15. 3
16. fseek() will change the offset of the file pointer, allowing you to
    manipulate where the pointer is when reading it in.
17. SEEK_CUR is a value for the int from_where variable in fseek() that will
    allow you to change the file pointer from its current position.
